                        Tucked into the first floor of the Tower next to the gift shops, there is a tiny post office.
                        Pick up une carte postale and a stamp and have it mailed from the Eiffel Tower’s post office and
                        it will be delivered with the unique postmark.

                        be demolished, including the Tower. Thankfully, the military governor in charge did not follow
                        through with this command!

                        When the Eiffel Tower was built, many eminent intellectuals of the day (including famous French
                        author Guy de Maupassant) protested vehemently against it, calling it ‘a gigantic black
                        smokestack’ that would ruin the beauty of Paris.</p> </b>

                from the Champagne Bar built into the top floor. There's nothing like a glass of bubbly with a
                spectacular view.</p> </b>

                Yes, the Eiffel Tower was supposed to be a temporary installation for the 1889 World Fair, held at Paris
                to commemorate 100 years of the French Revolution. It was ultimately never taken down because an antenna
                was built at the top of the Tower to conduct wireless signals. The Eiffel Tower is still used today to
                beam radio and TV broadcasts around the world.
